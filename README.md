# EnergyDataAnalysis
Hack Harvard 2017 project designed to use previous energy data to predict future CO2 emissions.  The program also uses S&P 500 data in order to draw conclusions between the economy and different emissions outputs.

## Conclusion
1. Total Energy emmisions don't appear to be decreasing at a rapid enough rate to be considered a trend
2. In the past CO2 emmisions have gernally correlated with S&P 500.  
3. While coal used to be very closely correlated with the S&P 500, after 2003, it now seems to be on a steep decline while the S&P index continues to increase.
